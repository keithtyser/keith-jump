Structure the codebase into multiple files and directories, each handling specific responsibilities (e.g., player.js for player logic, platforms.js for platform generation, ui.js for UI components).  

Avoid creating a single monolithic file to ensure the project remains maintainable and scalable as complexity grows.  

Use ES6 modules (import/export) to manage dependencies between files cleanly and efficiently.
