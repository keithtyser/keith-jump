# Keith Jump Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure (Completed)
- Created core directory structure:
  - `src/` - Main source code
  - `src/scenes/` - Phaser scene files
  - `src/assets/` - Asset storage
  - `src/assets/images/` - Image assets (sprites, backgrounds)
  - `src/assets/audio/` - Audio assets (sound effects, music)
- Created initial files:
  - `index.html` - Main entry point with responsive meta tags and game container
  - `src/main.js` - Game configuration placeholder
  - `src/scenes/GameScene.js` - Main gameplay scene placeholder
  - `src/scenes/StartScene.js` - Start screen scene placeholder  
  - `src/scenes/GameOverScene.js` - Game over scene placeholder
- Configured mobile-friendly settings in HTML
- Set up placeholders for future asset loading
- Successfully tested initial load in browser

## Step 2: Configure the Phaser Game (Completed)
- Implemented Phaser configuration in main.js:
  - Set game dimensions to 400x600 pixels
  - Configured Arcade physics with gravity (y: 120)
  - Added GameScene to the scene array
  - Set up responsive scaling with FIT mode
  - Added proper audio configuration to handle browser autoplay policies
  - Added WebGL rendering configuration to optimize performance and reduce warnings
- Created GameScene class structure with preload, create, and update methods
- Added placeholders for future asset loading in preload method
- Created a local development server (server.js) to resolve CORS issues with ES modules
- Added README.md with setup instructions
- Added event listeners to properly resume audio context on user interaction
- Successfully tested the game loads with a blank canvas

## Next Steps
- Step 3: Add Static Platforms (Pending)
  - Create static platform group
  - Add initial platforms for testing
