# Keith Jump Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Project Structure (Completed)
- Created core directory structure:
  - `src/` - Main source code
  - `src/scenes/` - Phaser scene files
  - `src/assets/` - Asset storage
  - `src/assets/images/` - Image assets (sprites, backgrounds)
  - `src/assets/audio/` - Audio assets (sound effects, music)
- Created initial files:
  - `index.html` - Main entry point with responsive meta tags and game container
  - `src/main.js` - Game configuration placeholder
  - `src/scenes/GameScene.js` - Main gameplay scene placeholder
  - `src/scenes/StartScene.js` - Start screen scene placeholder  
  - `src/scenes/GameOverScene.js` - Game over scene placeholder
- Configured mobile-friendly settings in HTML
- Set up placeholders for future asset loading
- Successfully tested initial load in browser

## Step 2: Configure the Phaser Game (Completed)
- Implemented Phaser configuration in main.js:
  - Set game dimensions to 400x600 pixels
  - Configured Arcade physics with gravity (y: 120)
  - Added GameScene to the scene array
  - Set up responsive scaling with FIT mode
  - Added proper audio configuration to handle browser autoplay policies
  - Added WebGL rendering configuration to optimize performance and reduce warnings
- Created GameScene class structure with preload, create, and update methods
- Added placeholders for future asset loading in preload method
- Created a local development server (server.js) to resolve CORS issues with ES modules
- Added README.md with setup instructions
- Added event listeners to properly resume audio context on user interaction
- Successfully tested the game loads with a blank canvas

## Step 3: Add Static Platforms (Completed)
- Implemented platform creation in GameScene.js:
  - Created a static physics group for platforms
  - Added 7 platforms with random x-coordinates (40-360) and fixed vertical spacing
  - Set platform dimensions to 80x15 pixels with green color (#6BBA75)
  - Configured platforms with y-positions ranging from 550 to ~100 pixels
  - Added spacing between platforms ranging from 80-150 pixels
- Created a platformTypes object as a foundation for future platform variations:
  - Standard (green, static)
  - Moving (blue, horizontal movement) - placeholder for future implementation
  - Breakable (orange, break-on-jump) - placeholder for future implementation
- Successfully tested that platforms appear correctly on screen

## Step 4: Add the Player Character (Completed)
- Created the player character in GameScene.js:
  - Added a rectangular player sprite at position (200, 550)
  - Set player dimensions to 50x70 pixels with blue color (#4287f5)
  - Enabled Arcade Physics for the player to interact with the physics system
  - Set the player's bounce property to 0 for manual handling of jumping mechanics
- Added placeholder for sound effects management:
  - Created a sfx object to store future sound references
  - Added commented code for future jump sound implementation
- Successfully tested that the player appears on screen and falls due to gravity

## Step 5: Implement Player Horizontal Movement (Completed)
- Implemented player movement controls in GameScene.js:
  - Set up keyboard input using Phaser's input manager for arrow keys
  - Added support for alternative A/D keys for movement
  - Implemented touch/mobile input support:
    - Added event listeners for pointer down, move, and up events
    - Created touch tracking variables to monitor user interaction
    - Determined left/right movement based on touch position relative to screen center
  - Added movement logic in the update method:
    - Implemented a movement direction system (-1 for left, 0 for none, 1 for right)
    - Set the player's horizontal velocity to 300 pixels per second based on direction
    - Ensured movement stops when no input is detected
- Successfully tested that the player moves left and right with keyboard and touch controls

## Step 6: Implement Automatic Jumping on Platforms (Completed)
- Implemented platform collision and jumping mechanics:
  - Added a physics collider between the player and platforms
  - Created a collision check function (checkPlatformCollision) that enforces one-way collision:
    - Only allows collisions when player is falling down (positive y velocity)
    - Only registers collision when player's bottom is above platform's top
    - Prevents collision when jumping up through platforms
  - Implemented a collision handler function (handlePlatformCollision) that:
    - Sets player's y-velocity to -800 to create the jumping effect
    - Added placeholder for jump sound effect
  - Created a complete jumping cycle where the player:
    - Falls due to gravity
    - Bounces upward upon landing on platforms
    - Can pass through platforms from below
- Successfully tested that player automatically jumps when landing on platforms

## Next Steps
- Step 7: Implement Screen Wrap-Around (Pending)
  - Add horizontal screen wrap-around for player movement
  - Set player position when moving off screen edges
